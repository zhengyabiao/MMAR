ACC41740.1	Note	function unknown; contains high domain identity with epoxide hydrolases. they comprise a group of functionally related enzymes that catalyse the addition of water to oxirane compounds (epoxides), thereby usually generating vicinal trans-diols. EHs have been found in all types of living organisms, including mammals, invertebrates, plants, fungi and bacteria. in animals, the major interest in eh is directed towards their detoxification capacity for epoxides since they are important safeguards against the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of oxirane derivatives that are often reactive electrophiles because of the high tension of the three- membered ring system and the strong polarisation of the C-- O bonds. this is of significant relevance because epoxides are frequent intermediary metabolites which arise during the biotransformation of foreign compounds. this family is often found in conjunction with pfam00561

GDC consists of four proteins P, H, L and T. the reaction catalysed by this protein is: glycine + lipoylprotein = s-aminomethyldihydrolipoylprotein + CO2

MurC transfers the L-alanine, MurD transfers the D-glutamate, MurE transfers the diaminopimelic acid, and MurF transfers the D-alanyl alanine. this family also includes folylpolyglutamate synthase that transfers glutamate to folylpolyglutamate

ACC40237.1	Name	ACC40237.1
ACC40237.1	Note	in nitrogen-limiting conditions, when the ratio of Gln to 2-ketoglutarate decreases, P-II is uridylylated to P-II-UMP by GlnD. P-II-UMP allows the deadenylylation of glutamine synthetase (gs), thus activating the enzyme. converserly, in nitrogen excess P-II is deuridylated and promotes the adenylation of gs. P-II indirectly controls the transcription of the gs gene. P-II prevents NR-II catalyzed conversion of NR-I to NR-I-phosphate, the transcriptional activator of GlnA. when P-II is uridylylated to P-II-UMP, these events are reversed

ACC38679.1	Note	this family consists of glycine cleavage system P- proteins from bacterial, mammalian and plant sources. the P protein is part of the glycine decarboxylase multienzyme complex also annotated as glycine cleavage system or glycine synthase. the P protein binds the alpha-amino group of glycine through its pyridoxal phosphate cofactor, carbon dioxide is released and the remaining methylamin moiety is then transferred to the lipoamide cofactor of the H protein. GDC consists of four proteins P, H, L and T. the reaction catalysed by this protein is: glycine + lipoylprotein = s-aminomethyldihydrolipoylprotein + CO2
