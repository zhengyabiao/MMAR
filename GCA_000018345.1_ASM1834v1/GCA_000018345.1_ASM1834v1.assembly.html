<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This track shows the sequences used in the 15 Apr 2008 <em>Mycobacterium marinum M</em>/GCA_000018345.1_ASM1834v1 genome assembly.

The definition of the sequences in this assembly is from the AGP file(s):<br>

in this <a href="https://genome-test.gi.ucsc.edu/gbdb/hubs/genbank/bacteria/GCA_000018345.1_ASM1834v1/" target=_blank>build directory</a><br>
The NCBI document

In dense mode, this track depicts the contigs that make up the 
currently viewed scaffold. 
Contig boundaries are distinguished by the use of alternating gold and brown 
coloration. Where gaps
exist between contigs, spaces are shown between the gold and brown
blocks.  The relative order and orientation of the contigs
within a scaffold is always known; therefore, a line is drawn in the graphical
display to bridge the blocks.</p>
